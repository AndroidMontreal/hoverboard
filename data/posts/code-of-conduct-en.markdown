## Purpose
### Why?
#### Why do we have an official anti-harassment policy for Women Techmakers events?

 - It sets expectations for behavior at the event. Simply having an anti-harassment policy can prevent harassment.
 - It encourages people to attend who have had bad experiences at other events.
 - It gives event staff/volunteers instructions on how to handle harassment quickly, with the minimum amount of disruption for the event.

Women Techmakers Montreal is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of:

 - gender
 - sexual orientation
 - disability
 - gender identity
 - age
 - race
 - religion
 - nationality

### Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Behavior
### Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before a conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior
The above is not an exhaustive list — we do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be expelled from the event, and even banned from future events at the discretion of the event organizers/management.

Harassment includes (but is not limited to):

 - offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion
 - the use or display of sexual images in public spaces
 - deliberate intimidation
 - stalking
 - harassing photography or recording
 - sustained disruption of talks or other events
 - inappropriate physical contact
 - unwelcome sexual attention

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
​​​Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibiting partners and guest speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and speakers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material, or otherwise create a sexualized environment in their slide decks, exhibit material, exhibit staffing, promotional items or demo material.
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.


If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event.
